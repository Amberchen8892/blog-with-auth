    <p class="lead">
      This is where youâ€™ll meet software developers who learned their craft from
      a variety of sources: from traditional college education, to self-paced
      video-based platforms, to coding bootcamps and beyond. How we learn to
      code is one of the most important stories we can share during our
      developer journeys.
